# SnakesAndLadder-JS


# Snakes & Ladders Game

This is a simple implementation of the traditional board game, Snakes & Ladders. Players roll a dice and move forward on the game board. If a player lands on a cell that represents the base of a ladder, they move to the cell at the top of the ladder. If a player lands on a cell with the head of a snake, they must move to the cell at the snake's tail. The first player to reach or cross the last cell wins the game.

## Modules

The game uses several modules:

- `player.js`: This module defines the Player class.
- `gameBoard.js`: This module initializes and displays the game board.
- `dice.js`: This module simulates rolling a dice.
- `config.js`: This module contains configuration for the game such as the number of rows and columns in the game board.
- `state.js`: This module maintains the state of the cell.
- `powerManager.js`: This module manages the power-ups (snakes and ladders) encountered by players on the game board. It decides which power-up (snake or ladder) to place at a position on the game board. If a player lands on a cell with a ladder, they climb it and their position changes accordingly. If a player lands on a cell with a snake, they slide down to its tail. The module exports the powerManager object which has the following methods:
    - `decidePower(pos)`: This method decides which power-up to place at a given position on the game board.
    - `givePower(powerUp, currPos)`: This method returns the new position of a player after they encounter a power-up.

The powerManager object uses two other objects, ladderObject and snakeObject, each representing a ladder and a snake respectively. Both objects have the following methods:

   - `setPower(pos)`: This method sets the end position of a ladder or snake at a given position on the game board.
   - `givePower(pos)`: This method returns the end position of a ladder or snake at a given position on the game board.
